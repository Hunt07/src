üöç Public Scheduling System UI

1. Introduction üìö

Project Overview:
The Public Scheduling System UI project provides a user-friendly interface for managing and interacting with public transportation schedules, including both buses and trains. 
This project is part of a collaborative effort, where my focus was on developing a responsive and intuitive UI. 
The next step involves integrating the backend to make this system fully functional.

Objective:
The goal is to create a comprehensive, secure, and scalable system tailored to public transportation needs. 
The UI is designed to be flexible, allowing for easy backend integration and providing a seamless user experience.

2. Project Structure üõ†Ô∏è
   
Directory Overview:
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HomePage.java          # Main entry point for the application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AdminDashboard.java    # Admin interface for managing schedules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ booking.java           # Handles booking operations for users
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loading.java           # Displays a loading screen during startup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.java               # Main application class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bg.png                 # Background image used in the UI
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .git/                  # Git metadata and version control

Key Components:
	‚Ä¢	HomePage.java: The starting point of the UI.
	‚Ä¢	AdminDashboard.java: Provides an interface for administrators to manage schedules.
	‚Ä¢	booking.java: Allows users to book trips.
	‚Ä¢	loading.java: A visually appealing loading screen for a smooth startup experience.

3. Backend Implementation Options üíª
   This UI is designed to be adaptable, supporting multiple backend implementation strategies. Below are two possible approaches:

   - Simple Arrays for Data Handling
     
     Overview:
     For a simpler, prototype-level implementation, using arrays or array lists can be a quick and effective solution.

      Steps:
      	1.	Data Structures: Define arrays or array lists to store schedules, bookings, and user information.
      	2.	Basic Operations: Implement methods to manipulate these data structures.
      	3.	UI Integration: Adjust the UI components to work with these in-memory data structures.
      	   import java.util.ArrayList;

      _Sample Code:_
            public class ScheduleManager {
                private ArrayList<Schedule> schedules = new ArrayList<>();
                public void addSchedule(Schedule schedule) {
                    schedules.add(schedule);
                }
                public void removeSchedule(int index) {
                    if (index >= 0 && index < schedules.size()) {
                        schedules.remove(index);
                    }
                }
                public ArrayList<Schedule> getSchedules() {
                    return schedules;
                }
            }
    - SQL Database Integration
      
      Overview
      For a production-level application, integrating with a SQL database is recommended to handle data persistence and complex queries.

      Steps:
      	1.	Database Selection: Choose a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
      	2.	Schema Design: Create tables for Users, Schedules, Bookings, etc.
      	3.	Database Connection: Use JDBC or ORM tools like Hibernate to connect the UI with the database.
      	4.	CRUD Operations: Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations to manage data effectively.

      _Sample Code:_
            import java.sql.Connection;
            import java.sql.DriverManager;
            import java.sql.SQLException;
            public class DatabaseConnector {
                private static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/public_schedule_db";
                private static final String USER = "root";
                private static final String PASSWORD = "password";
                public static Connection getConnection() {
                    try {
                        return DriverManager.getConnection(URL, USER, PASSWORD);
                    } catch (SQLException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                        return null;
                    }
                }
            }
